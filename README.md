Student Management System


This project is a Student Management System built using C++ with linked lists to manage student records. It provides basic functionalities like inserting, searching, counting, updating, deleting, and displaying students' information. The system also allows sorting of students based on their roll numbers.



Features:


Insert Student: Add a new student to the system, ensuring that the student ID and roll number are unique.

Search Student: Search for a student by their ID.


Count Students: Display the total number of students.


Update Student: Modify a student's details, such as name, roll number, age, and course.


Delete Student: Remove a student from the system using their ID.


Show All Students: Display all student records in a tabular format.


Sort Students by Roll Number: Sort the student list by roll number in ascending order.


Duplicate Check: Ensures that no two students have the same ID or roll number.



Data Structure:


The project uses linked lists to store and manage student data dynamically, making it easy to add and remove records without memory constraints.
